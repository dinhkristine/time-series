```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6)
```


```{r}

set.seed(2)

```

### c) ACF

```{r}

# a) AR(2) series with phi = 1.3 and -0.4 
y.50 <-  arima.sim(model = list(ar = c(1.3, -0.4)), n = 100)

# plot ACF of AR(1) series with phi = 0.5 
acf(y.50)

y_acf_values <- acf(y.50, plot = FALSE)

y_acf_values$acf

```

Comparing the ACF from Exercise 3.1 c, both have similar values.

### PACF 

```{r}

acf(y.50, type = "partial")

y_pacf_values <- acf(y.50, plot = FALSE, type = "partial")

y_pacf_values$acf

```

Values of PACF are slightly more or less than 0 when k > 2, which is still relatively similar to answer from Exercise 3.1 c.
